I'm excited to share my latest project where I created a dynamic data visualization dashboard using Power BI. Hereâ€™s a quick overview:

1. Column Chart:
   - Data: Locations and number of wins.
   - Steps: Dragged "Location" and "Wins" from the Team Stats table into a table, then converted it into a clustered column chart.
   - Insight: Houston had the highest wins, while Phoenix had the fewest.

2. KPI Cards:
   - Metrics: Number of teams, games played, and clutch games played.
   - Steps: Used card visualization, dragged respective fields, and formatted for better visibility.
   - Insights: Displayed counts and totals for key metrics.

3. Gauge:
   - Metric: Points with minimum, maximum, and average values.
   - Steps: Added points field and set up minimum, maximum, and target values for a comprehensive gauge visualization.
   - Insight: Min: 98, Max: 113, Avg: 106.

4. Map Visualization:
   - Data: Team locations and number of wins.
   - Steps: Mapped locations and set circle sizes based on wins.
   - Insight: Geographic distribution of wins, with Houston having the largest circle.

5. Line and Clustered Column Chart:
   - Data: Location, wins, defensive rating, points, and clutch games.
   - Steps: Combined columns for wins and lines for other metrics.
   - Insight: Displayed multiple performance metrics per location.

6. Pie Chart:
   - Data: Location and clutch games.
   - Steps: Used location as the legend and clutch games as values.
   - Insight: Visualized the distribution of clutch games across locations.
